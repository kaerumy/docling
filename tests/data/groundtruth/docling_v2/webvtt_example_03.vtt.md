00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:08.571

Speaker A:  OK, I think now we should be recording

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/15-1

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.403

Speaker A:  properly.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/16-0

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:11.563

Good.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/17-0

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:13.803

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/78-0

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:53.363

Speaker B:  I was also thinking.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/113-0

00:00:54.963 --> 00:01:02.072

Speaker B:  Would be maybe good to create items,

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/113-1

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:06.811

Speaker B:  some metadata, some options that can be specific.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/150-0

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.014

Speaker A:  Yeah, I mean I think you went even more than

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/119-0

00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:12.643

Speaker B:  But we preserved the atoms.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/150-1

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.907

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/197-1

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:51.643

Speaker A:  give it a try, yeah.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/200-0

00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:55.043

Speaker B:  Okay, talk to you later.

62357a1d-d250-41d5-a1cf-6cc0eeceffcc/202-0
