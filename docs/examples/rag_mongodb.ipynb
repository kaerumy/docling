The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.',\n",

This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

    "This notebook demonstrated a powerful RAG pipeline using MongoDB, VoyageAI, and Azure OpenAI. By combining MongoDB's vector search capabilities with VoyageAI's embeddings and Azure OpenAI's language models, we created an intelligent document retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements:\n",
    "- Processed documents with Docling\n",
    "- Generated contextual embeddings with VoyageAI\n",
    "- Stored vectors in MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "- Implemented semantic search for relevant context retrieval\n",
    "- Generated accurate responses with Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Expand your knowledge base with more documents\n",
    "2. Experiment with chunking and embedding parameters\n",
    "3. Build a user interface\n",
    "4. Implement evaluation metrics\n",
    "5. Deploy to production with proper scaling\n",
